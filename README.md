# calcium-clustering

I made this repo mainly for myself, to write scripts to analyze my calcium live imaging data with R.

My principal aims are:

1. To tidy up the raw data produced by image analysis of my calcium signaling time-lapses by ImageJ/Fiji;
2. To identify potential divergences against control;
3. To make these divergences easy to see by making nice looking plots.
